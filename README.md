# Game Picker

### Project Goals
This project was to come up with an idea and a minimal vialble product in 4 days. I decided to create a steam game picker.
Using the Steam games API, could download a user's game library. Then match that information with game information, displaying each game in a card that is filterable by genre.

### Next steps:
Add modal for additional info when clicking on an individual game.
Add a button to select a random game.


### Technologies Used
React, Node, Express, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Heroku
